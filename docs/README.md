# Documentation

This project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the Material theme.

## Getting started

1. Install the Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
   ```
2. To preview the site locally, run:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
3. Build the static site:
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```

The documentation lives in this `docs/` directory, and the configuration is in `mkdocs.yml`.

The published site is available at <https://lmdb.nibzard.com>.
